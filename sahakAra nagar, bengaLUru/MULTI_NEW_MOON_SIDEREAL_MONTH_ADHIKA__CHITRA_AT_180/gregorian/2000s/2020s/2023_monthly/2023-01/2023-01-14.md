When a trip─Бdanakс╣гatra is conjoined with a bhadr─Б tithi i.e. dvit─лy─Б, saptam─л or dv─Бda┼Ы─л, and this falls on a Tuesday, Sunday or Saturday, it is known as a tripuс╣гkara-y┼Нgaс╕е. The dvipuс╣гkara occurs when the bhadr─Б tithis coincide with the same days as above, but with the dvip─Бda nakс╣гatras, which are mr╠еga┼Ы─лrс╣гa, chitr─Б and dhaniс╣гс╣нh─Б. Like the tripuс╣гkara which gives a three-fold multiplier for ┼Ыubha and a┼Ыubha, the dvipuс╣гkara has a two-fold effect.

### рдкрд╛рдиреАрдпрдкрдереЗ рдкрд░рд╛рдЬрд┐рддрд┐рд░реН рд╣рд┐рдиреНрджреБрдХрд╛рдирд╛рдореН #реиремреи

Event occured on 1761-01-14 (gregorian). 

Sad anniversary of 3rd battle of pAnIpat where ahmed shAh abdAli defeated the starving, outmaneouvred, civilian heavy Maratha forces under the 31 yr old sadAshivarAv bhAu with the bold 19 year old vishvAs rAv, with cataclysmic effects accross India (including the loss of star generals and rise of Hyder ali).

#### Overview
Tactically - Durrani had both numeric as well as qualitative superiority over Marathas. 

Strategically - Sadashivrao (unlike Malharrao Holkar or Raghunathrao) was totally ignorant of the political and military situation in North India. Ahmad Shah's superiority in pitched battle could have been negated if the Marathas had conducted their traditional ganimi kava, or guerrilla warfare, as advised by Malharrao Holkar, in Punjab and in north India.

#### Context
In a series of strenuous tactical moves, Abdali and bhau tried to outmaneouvre and trap each other. Abdali succeeded upon crossing yamunA and trapping the marATha-s at pAnIpat. Facing a potential stalemate, Abdali decided to seek terms, which Bhau was willing to consider. However, Najib Khan delayed any chance of an agreement with an appeal on religious grounds and sowed doubt about whether the Marathas would honour any agreement.

Unable to continue without supplies, Bhau decided to break the siege. His plan was to pulverise the enemy formations with cannon fire and not to employ his cavalry until the Afghans were thoroughly softened up. With the Afghans broken, he would move camp in a defensive formation towards Delhi, where they were assured supplies.

#### Battle
The Marathas left their camp before dawn and marched south towards the Afghan camp in a desperate attempt to break the siege. The two armies came face-to-face around 8:00 a.m. Bhau, with the Peshwa's son and the royal guard (Huzurat), was in the centre. 

- Left wing: Gardis under Ibrahim Khan. 
- Holkar and Sindhia were on the extreme right. 
- The Maratha line was formed up some 12 km across, with the artillery in front, protected by infantry, pikemen, musketeers and bowmen. 
- The cavalry was instructed to wait behind the artillery and bayonet-wielding musketeers. 
- Behind this line was another ring of 30,000 young Maratha soldiers who were not battle-tested, and then the civilians. 

- Maratha troops broke their fast with sugared water.
- Maratha left flank under Ibrahim Khan, who advanced his infantry in formation, attacked.
- First Afghan attack by Najib Khan's Rohillas was broken by Maratha bowmen and pikemen, along with a unit of the famed Gardi musketeers. The second and subsequent salvos were fired at point-blank range into the Afghan ranks. 8,000 Gardi musketeers killed about 12,000 Rohillas.
- Bhau himself led the charge against the left-of-center Afghan forces, under the Afghan Vizier Shah Wali Khan. Afghan soldiers started to desert their positions in the confusion. Shah Wali appealed to Shuja ud Daulah in vain. But, incomplete success - many of the half-starved Maratha mounts were exhausted, no heavy armoured cavalry units for the Marathas to maintain these openings. Abdali deployed his Nascibchi musketeers to gun down the deserters who finally stopped and returned to the field.
- The Marathas, under Scindia, attacked Najib. Najib successfully defended.
- By noon it looked as though Bhau would clinch victory at center. Ahmad Shah had watched the fortunes of the battle from his tent, guarded by the still unbroken forces on his left. He sent his bodyguards to call up his 15,000 reserve troops from his camp and arranged them as a column in front of his cavalry of musketeers (Qizilbash) and 2,000 swivel-mounted shutarnaals or UshtranaalтАФcannons.  Maratha cavalry was unable to withstand them.
- Abdali pressed further troops and intensified the attack. With their own men in the firing line, the Maratha artillery could not respond to the shathurnals and the cavalry charge. Some 7,000 Maratha cavalry and infantry were killed before the hand-to-hand fighting began at around 14:00 hrs. By 16:00 hrs, the tired Maratha infantry began to succumb to the onslaught of attacks from fresh Afghan reserves, protected by armoured leather jackets.
- Sadashiv Rao Bhau who had not kept any reserves, seeing his forward lines dwindling, civilians behind and upon seeing Vishwasrao disappear in the midst of the fighting, felt he had no choice but to come down from his elephant and lead the battle. Taking advantage of this, the Afghan soldiers who had been captured by the Marathas earlier during the Siege of Kunjpura revolted. The prisoners unwrapped their green belts and wore them as turbans to impersonate the troops of the Durrani Empire and began attacking from within. Some Maratha troops in the vanguard panicked and retreated.
- Bhausaheb had ordered Vitthal Vinchurkar (with 1500 cavalry) and Damaji Gaikwad (with 2500 cavalry) to protect the Gardis. However, after seeing the Gardis having no clearing for directing their cannon fire at the enemy troops, they lost their patience and decided to fight the Rohillas themselves. The Rohilla riflemen mowed them down. Gardis fell next.
- Vishwasrao had already been killed by a shot to the head. Bhau and the Huzurati royal forces fought till the end.
- At this stage, the Holkar and Scindia contingents, realising the battle was lost, merged their forces with one contingent breaking from the Maratha right flank and escaped from the opening in the Durrani lines southwards as Jankoji Rao Scindia lead the other contingent to reinforce the thinning lines of Marathas.

#### Aftermath
- The Maratha front lines remained largely intact, with some of their artillery units fighting until sunset. Choosing not to launch a night attack, many Maratha troops escaped that night. Bhau's wife Parvatibai, who was assisting in the administration of the Maratha camp, escaped to Pune with her bodyguard, Janu Bhintada along with Nana Fadnavis under the protection of Malhar Rao Holkar's contingent. Some 15,000 soldiers managed to reach Gwalior. Ibrahim Khan Gardi was tortured and executed by enraged Afghan soldiers.
- Jankoji Scindia was taken prisoner and executed at the instigation of Najib. 
- Afghan cavalry and pikemen ran wild through the streets of Panipat, killing tens of thousands of Maratha soldiers and civilians. Afghan officers who had lost their kin in battle were permitted to carry out massacres of Marathas the next day also, in Panipat and the surrounding area. 40,000 Maratha prisoners were slaughtered in cold blood the day after the battle.
- Some 22,000 women and children were driven off as slaves.
- Marathas never fully recovered from the loss at Panipat, but they remained the predominant military power. 
- The Jats under Suraj Mal benefited significantly from not participating in the Battle of Panipat. They provided considerable assistance to the Maratha soldiers and civilians who escaped the fighting.

#### Revenge
By 1771, marATha-s were again in firm control of Red fort. 

They rampaged and utterly destroyed the Rohillas. Najib's corpse was shredded to pieces and tomb demolished. His son Zabita fled his family, converted to Sikhism & passed away in obscurity. His grandson was castrated & made a catamite by the Mughal Badshah (by then a marATha puppet).

Shujah-Ud-Daulah's army was destroyed by Britishers because of lack of Maratha support & ended up becoming their pawn.

##### Abdali
Abdali retreated back to Afghanistan. Had Abdali not fled India, he would have to contend against Maratha army of 100,000 Warriors under Raghunathrao & Peshwa Nanasaheb, 20,000 Gard├йs under General De Bussy himself, 10,000 Nagpur Bargirs under Senasahebsubah Janojiraje alongwith 15,000 promised Mughal Nizam troopers! 

Abdali himself died a brutal death due to his gangrenous maggot-infested nasal infection.
