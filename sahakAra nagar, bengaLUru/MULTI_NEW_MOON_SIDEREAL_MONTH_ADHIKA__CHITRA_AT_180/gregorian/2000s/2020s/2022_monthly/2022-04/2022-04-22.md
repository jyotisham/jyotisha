## उत्सवाः
- अज्मेर-स्त्री-बल-भोज-वार्ता #३०, राजशाहि-हत्या #६०
### अज्मेर-स्त्री-बल-भोज-वार्ता #३०

Event occured on 1992-04-22 (gregorian). 

On this day, a local new paper of Ajmer, Dainik Navajyoti, broke the news about grooming and sexual exploitation of several hundred (mostly Hindu) girls orchestrated by a gang of youth (main accused belonging to the khAdim family of the Islamic Ajmer DargAh, who also happened to be local leaders of Congress (I)). The scandal had come to police attention a year earlier - but they took scant action, blaming reticence of victims and possibility of hindu-muslim riots. Among those who eventually faced trial were Among those who face trial are Farooq Chishtee, president of the Ajmer Youth Congress, Nafis Chishtee and Anwar Chishtee, vice-president and joint secretary respectively of the city unit.

#### Context and events
- Ajmer was ahead of time in modernity - and the reason was prestigious colleges like Mayo, Sophia and Savitri college. 
- It started with girls (1990) being lured by expensive gifts, (initially Farooq Chisti) bringing the girl-friend to a farmhouse, another boy taking intimate pictures, subsequent blackmail and rape, followed by pressure to lure another young girl and so on (eg. Rashmi → Sunita → Madhuri). This cascaded to hundreds of girls being raped.
- There were 8-10 boys in the gang : Farooq, Nafees, Anwar, Puttan, Salim, Ishrat, Shamshusdin, Suhail etc. 
- A victim, Madhuri (pseudonym), had informed a police constable and a special branch officer in the first half of 1991. But she started getting threatening phone calls. When trying to recover the photographs, an accused even sauntered up in front of the police and said "they've played this game before"; the photos were not returned. She eventually moved to a different city. 
- Influencial lechers, including policement and businessmen got wind of it, and the grooming rape operation expanded and shifted to a famous Ajmer club.
- Eventually, 6 girl students committed suicide by hanging. Later still, one burned herself to death in a major street.
- Photo copies were sent by a shocked neighbor of the reel developer to VHP and Dainik Navjyoti.
- Finally, journalist Santosh Kumar Gupta and editor DB Choudhary of Dainik Navjyoti broke the story. 24 days later, they followed up by publishing pictures of local girls, which had been circulating. "Finally, we decided to go ahead because it was the only way to shake the administration and police out of their slumber." said the editor. Other newspapers followed suit.


#### Aftermath
- Ajmer erupted into bandhs and rallies. On 27 May, police invoked the National Security Act (NSA) to arrest 8 of the accused.
- No girl came for FIR initially - but eventually a handful of the girls turned up. Ajmer Mahila Samooh, who tried to take up the victim's cause, withdrew after receiving threats.
- 18 persons were accused by the police. Few of them were: Farooq Chisti, Salim, Mojiulla, Ishart Ali, Anwar, Shamsudin (Maradona), Nafees Chisti, Suhail, Purshottam (photo reel developer), Mahesh Ludhani (Owner of Photo color lab), Harish tulani. 15 were nabbed.
- Ajmer, and its top schools fell into disrepute. People used to enquiry at newspaper office - humari ladki ki bhi photo hai kya? “No one wanted to marry girls from Ajmer." said Gupta.
  - Boarding facilities of Savitri School and Sophia School have remained shut down.
- Eventually, on the order of CM, police raided on all video parlors and confiscated many video cassettes and pictures.
- A journalist madan singh, running "Lehro ki barkha" tabloid, published more pics. He even allegedly tried to blackmail the girls. He fell out with powerful accomplices, named some politicians, and was assassinated with a shotgun and two pistols on 12th Sep 1992 (after attempts on his life had begun on Sep 4).


#### Trial
- During trial, most of the girls who had come forward backed off. 2 remained. In 1998, Sessions Judge of Ajmer found all the accused guilty and sentenced them to life imprisonment. In 2001, High court acquitted Parvez Ansari, Mahesh Ludhani, Kailash Soni and Harish Tolani of all the charges levelled against them. Also reduced the sentence of 4 out of 8 accused from life imprisonment to 10 years. HC kept life imprisonment only for 4 accused Puttan, Ishrat, Anwar and Shamshuddin (Meradona). The main accused and mastermind Farooq Chisti supposedly "lost his mental balance" and trial against him was put on hold. He was later tried in 2007, given a punishment of 10 years imprisonment, and later in 2013 acquitted since he'd spent a "long time" in jail.
- In 2003, Supreme court reduced the sentence of remaining 4 accused who got life imprisonment to 10 years. So the final judgement was 10 years imprisonment to 8 accused.
- Nafis Chishty, also wanted for drug peddling, was nabbed wearing a burqa in 2003. Iqbal Bhat, evaded arrest until 2005. Salim Chisti (rapes started in his farm house) was caught in 2012.
- Suhail Ghani Chishty was caught in 2018.
- Those who completed their 10 year term are still living a luxurious life in Ajmer. As of 2022, Nafis Chishty, Iqbal Bhat, Saleem Chishty, Sayed Jamir Hussain, Naseem aka Tarzan, and Suhail Ghani — were undergoing trial in POCSO court, but they were all out on bail. Santosh Gupta said: "Nafis and Farooq Chishty are leading a privileged life in Ajmer and are frequent visitors to Dargah Sharif, where some of the faithful still ritualistically kiss their hands".
- The two witnesses, who have had to come to court for 30 years, suffered the most - one of them suffered a breakdown in court in late 2021. In 2005, witness "Krishnabala" disappeared. Another became pregnant, was raped again, became pregnant again (the born died), was trheatened on the streets, before withdrawing.

### राजशाहि-हत्या #६०

Event occured on 1962-04-22 (gregorian). 

Bangla muslim mobs attacked Hindus, motivated in part by Islamic Republic of Pakistan Army and government propaganda (including false stories about anti-muslim violence in India). An estimated 300 non-Muslims were killed in Rajshahi district alone. Around 11k Santhals and Rajbanshis migrated to India.

The intervention of the Indian Assistant High Commission resulted in the troops being called and the massacre was stopped.
