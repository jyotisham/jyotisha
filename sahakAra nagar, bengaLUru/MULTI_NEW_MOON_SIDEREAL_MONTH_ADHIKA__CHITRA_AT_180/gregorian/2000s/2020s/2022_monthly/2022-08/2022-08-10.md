### कुलाचल-युद्धम् #२८१

Event occured on 1741-08-10 (gregorian). 

On this day, not far from kanyAkumArI, Battle of Colachel (or The Battle of Kulachal) was fought, where the forces of padmanAbhapura's king mArtANDa varma defeated Duch East India Company forces led by Admiral Eustachius De Lannoy. The battle had lasted for months. Some records date the surrender to 7th August.

#### Aftermath
The Dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to India. In 1753, the Dutch signed the Treaty of Mavelikkara with the Dutch agreeing not to obstruct the Raja's expansion, and in turn, to sell to him arms and ammunition. Indian government has built a pillar of victory in Kulachal to commemorate the event.

The Dutch continued fighting for a bit from Kanyakumari, Paravur and AyirUr. They gave up on kanyAkumArI in October. 

Soon after the surrender, Marthanda Varma imprisoned high level European officers and native Christian collaborators. The Travancore forces captured a large number of muskets and some cannons. Later, Marthanda Varma gave them their weapons back, and asked them to join the Travancore army. Some, including Admiral De Lannoy and Duyvenschot accepted. 

D'lennoy served for two decades, rising to the post of the Valiya kappithan (Senior Captain) and was buried at udayagiri fort (aka Dillanai koTai/ D'lennoy fort). De Lannoy was initially entrusted with the training of a few companies of the Maharajah's bodyguards and he did this with such an excellence that he was entrusted with modernizing the entire Travancore army - introducing better firearms, artilary and drills. He was one of the commanders of the Tranvancore army during the decisive battle of Ambalapuzha where his erstwhile employers were fighting on behalf of Cochin and her allies. He also built the Nedumkottai, a line of fortifications in the north of the kingdom, which stopped the French trained army of Tipu Sultan in 1789. This more effective army annexed Kollam (Quilon), Kayamkulam, Kottarakkara, Pandalam, Ambalapuzha, Edappalli, Thekkumkoor and Vadakkumkoor to lord padmanAbha's kingdom.

#### Context
In 1730s, mArtANDa varma started annexing and consolidating keraLa kingdoms. He refused to honor Duch monopoly agreements with the conquered kingdoms. In January 1739, Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff, the Dutch Governor of Ceylon, visited Kochi, and in a July report, he recommended military action. Later that year, the Dutch organised an alliance of the rulers of Kochi, Thekkumkur, Vadakkumkur, Purakkad, Kollam, and Kayamkulam.  Van Imhoff personally met Marthanda Varma to negotiate peace under Dutch terms. The Sun lord refused and replied that he had been thinking about invading Europe some day!!

In late 1739, the Dutch command at Malabar declared war on Travancore, without obtaining permission or waiting for reinforcements from Batavia. Captain Johannes Hackert came from Lanka with some troops. Dutch + allies scored several victories and forced the Travancore army stationed near Kollam to retreat. British East India Company chief at Anchuthengu congratulated the Dutch. By early December, the Dutch and their allies marched towards Attingal and Varkala. When the Travancore army withdrew to check an invasion by French ally Chanda Sahib of Arcot in the south, the allies achieved further military successes. 

In November 1740, the Dutch command in Malabar asked for more inforcements from Lanka, and launched a second campaign. By padmanAbha's grace, mArtANDa's army captured several dutch outposts. A small dutch force landed at kulachchal/ colachel and started fortifying. On 26 November, the Dutch sent two large ships and three sloops to Colachel, bombarding the coast.  On 29 November, the Dutch commander van Gollenesse announced a complete blockade of the Travancore coast around Colachel (except English ships). On 13 January 1741, the Dutch ship Maarseveen was sent southwards, to be anchored between Thengapattanam and Colachel. On 10 February, another Dutch expedition comprising seven large ships and several smaller vessels landed just north of Colachel. Dutch forces started capturing the nearby villages, and marched towards Eraniel. To effectively control the newly-conquered territories, the Dutch were expecting reinforcements to arrive from Ceylon and Batavia, but the Company Government at Batavia could not spare any reserve forces because of the Java War.

mArtANDa raised a 2k strong nAyar force and rushed south, as did his general Ramayyan Dalawa from north. A number of boats with local mukkuvAr seamen as rowers were set up - they cut off supplies from the sea. On 27 May, mArtANDa worshipped at the Adikesava Perumal Temple at Thiruvattar, consecrated his sword there. The Travancore army did not have any siege equipment, and therefore, Marthanda Varma intended to simply starve the Dutch garrison out. The Dutch troops at Colachel numbered around 400 (of which only around 150 were European), while the Travancore army had 12,000-15,000 soldiers. The heavy rains made it hard for them to keep their gunpowder dry, and made their weapons unusable. Travancore army, armed by the British then stationed in Anchuthengu (near Attingal), bombarded the makeshift tent near the shore where the Dutch had gathered all their ammunition. That one big explosion ended the war on 10 August.

### नोयाखाली-हत्या #७६

Event occured on 1946-08-10 (gregorian). 

The massacre of the Hindu population in Noakhali started on 10 October, on the day of Kojagari Lakshmi Puja.  It is estimated that 5,000 were killed, hundreds of Hindu women were raped and thousands of Hindu men and women were forcibly converted to Islam. Around 50,000 to 75,000 survivors were sheltered in temporary relief camps in Comilla, Chandpur, Agartala and other places. Around 50,000 Hindus remained marooned in the affected areas under the strict surveillance of the Muslims, where the administration had no say. According to Dinesh Chandra, Hindus were forced to pay subscriptions to the Muslim League and jiziyah.

### राक्षसभुवन-युद्धम् #२५९

Event occured on 1763-08-10 (gregorian). 

On this day, mAdhavarAv decimated the nizam's army on godAvarI banks.

Aftermath: Madhavrao proved his military acumen & courage through timely troop movements before, & during the battle. In stark contrast, Raghunathrao was seen as indecisive, & Madhavrao was made Peshwa again! Nana Fadnavis was restored to office, with his brother Moropant Phadnis too. Peshwa Madhavrao met Mahadji Shinde to confirm services.


Context: While the peshvA was in a southern campaign, the Nizam (allied with Janoji Bhosale of nAgpur and Chatrapati rAmarAja of kolhApur) decided to attack, as planned by his divAn viTThala-sundara. For a change, raghunAtharAv joined mAdhavarAv. With a carrot and stick policy, jAnojI secretly returned to the peshva camp. Marathas started deserting the Nizam. mAdhavarAv had sped north and decimated the nizAm's army on godAvarI banks.
