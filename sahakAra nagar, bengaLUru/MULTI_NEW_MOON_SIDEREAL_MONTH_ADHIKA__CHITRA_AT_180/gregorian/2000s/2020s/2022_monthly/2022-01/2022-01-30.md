## उत्सवाः
- गान्धिमारणम् #७४, पञ्च-पर्व-पूजा (चतुर्दशी), मासशिवरात्रिः, हसन-निज़ामि-रोधः #९४
### गान्धिमारणम् #७४

Event occured on 1948-01-30 (gregorian). 

nAthUrAm goDse (assisted by Narayan Apte) killed MK gAndhi (who DID NOT say "He Ram") in a stupid move which would set back Hindu interest by decades. Millions of Indians mourned Gandhi's assassination; the Hindu Mahasabha was vilified and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was temporarily banned.

In Anti-brAhmin riots (mostly by so-called marATha-s taking advantage of the situation),innocent brAhmaNas were killed (on the first day alone, 15 in Bombay and 50 in Pune), thousands of offices and homes were also set on fire. Greatest violence took place in Satara, Kolhapur and Belgaum. The biggest violence took place in the seven Patwardhan (Chitpawan) princely states such as Sangli, where the remarkably advanced factories owned by Chitpawans were largely destroyed. Here, Jains and Lingayats joined the Marathas in the attacks. The events hastened the integration of Patwardhan states (by march 1948) into the Bombay province.

N Godse was later executed on 15 November 1949.

### हसन-निज़ामि-रोधः #९४

Event occured on 1928-01-30 (gregorian). 

On this day, a bullet from shivarAm rAjaguru stopped Hassan Nizami's anti-hindu activities (albeit killing an unintended person).

#### The intended victim
Hassan Nizami (the famous sufi of Chishti order, of Nizamuddin Auliya's known silsilã) was indulging in frenzied anti-hindu activity - including conversions in Central Provinces.  Sita Ram Goel writes:
 
> He published in 1920 a big book, Fãtami Dãwat-i-Islam, in which he advocated all means, fair and foul, by which Hindus were to be converted to Islam. He advised the mullahs to concentrate on Hindu "untouchables", and convert them en masse so that Muslims could achieve parity of population with the Hindus. He disclosed in the introduction to his book that he had consulted many Muslim leaders including the Agha Khan regarding the soundness of his scheme, and that all of them had agreed with the caution that the scheme should be kept a closely guarded secret. Unfortunately for the Khwaja, the scheme came to the notice of Swami Shraddhananda who exposed it, fought it tooth and nail, and frustrated it completely by means of his Shuddhi Movement. 

Even MK Gandhi had objected to his pamphlets (ref. his collected writings). But, Svami shraddhananda was killed by an Islamist.

#### The attempt
Ganesh Damodar aka Babarao Savarkar had recruited many boys, including rAjaguru to his cause. He had him enrolled in "Amravati Vyaayaam Prasaarak Mandal" which was a gym. This boy was strong by constitution and was an excellent marksman. Archery and shooting were this boy's natural forte. He was summoned by Babarao and was given the task of "eliminating Hussain Nizami". 

Boy was happy at his first assignment. Since he was trained by likes of savarkar, he did all the necessary recce and info-gathering. Boy went to Delhi, studied routine of Nizam, set a trap and waited. Plan was to shoot nizam while his car passed thru a set point. The boy waited and he shot. Flawlessly! Unfortunately, that day it was Nizam's father in law (Somali) who was sitting in usual place where nizam sat.

Codename of Rajguru in this operation was "M" - "M" for Maratha. Veer Savarkar had used same pseudonym to write his "Hindutva" year before.

#### Aftermath
Hassan, although alive, got the message. Conversions stopped in CP.  
Though consoled by his colleagues Shiv Verma and Chandrashekhara AzAd, it is reported that he always felt guilty at killing the wrong person.
