### рдХреЗрд░рд▓-рд░рд╛рдорд╕рд┐рдВрд╣-рд╣рддреНрдпрд╛ #ренрел

Event occured on 1947-02-08 (gregorian). 

Ramasimhan, his brother Dayasimhan, DayasimhanтАЩs wife Kamala (daughter of Mangalath Manaykal Narayanan Nambudiri), their cook Raju Iyer and other members of the family were butchered by Islamist Jihadists in Malaparamba, Malappuram district on this day for converting to Hinduism from Islam, just two weeks before the independence, on this day at 2AM. The jihadis completely demolished the Narasimha Temple, looted the house, threw the idol into the pond, fulled the temple well with debris of the compound wall.

The massacre of RamasimhamтАЩs family was said to be sponsored by his Muslim father-in-law who couldnтАЩt bear their conversion to Hinduism.

#### Events
The muslim clerics had held a secret meeting, declared Ramasimhan an apostate and decided to inflict the death sentence on him, according to the Sharia. The then IS, Izzatul Islam, which was formed to help the new converts, was assigned the killing job.Seven people from Pookottur,formed the death squad - Paramban Mammad, Kunyatkalathil Moideen Kutty, Puliyan Muhammad, Muttayilkaran Aymutty, Nanath Kunjalavi, Kalathinkal Kunhamu and Illikkappadi Ayamu. They met at the estate of Abubakar Haji, prayed and began their journey with a gun and 20 bullets.

#### Background
RamasimhanтАЩs father Moidu Saheb, was trained in rubber cultivation. Moidu Saheb occupied 600 acres of Narasimha Moorti Temple land in Malaparamba, Malappuram. He started cultivating rubber in the Temple land, managed to get the land on lease and even constructed a bungalow in front of the Temple. Moidu and his sons Unnyen and Alippu, took out granite slabs and other beautiful ornate structures from the Temple and used them for his bungalow. The local Hindus, though horrified at the loot of the Temple could not muster any protest as they had suffered more than 10,000 deaths, thousands of rapes and plunder at the hands of the Moplahs in the anti-Hindu riots under the garb of Khilafat Movement.

Unnyen soon fell very sick and all medical treatment proved very futile. The astrologer asked him to rebuild the Narasimha Moorti Temple, which was in ruins and desecrated by his own father. Unnyen rebuilt the Temple and started worshipping Narasimha Bhagwan. He miraculously recovered from his illness. Unnyen, his brother Alippu and the whole family became Bhaktas of Mahavishnu. 

The whole family, Unnyen, his brother Alippu, AlippuтАЩs wife and UnnyenтАЩs sons Moidu and Moidootty underwent a Gharwapasi ceremony conducted by the Arya Samaj under Buddha Singh and embraced Hinduism in 1946. The incident was splashed in dailies and published in Fort St George Gazette. They also renamed themselves as Ramasimhan, Dayasimhan, Kamala, Fateh Singh and Swaravar Singh respectively (the names of Guru Gobind SinghтАЩs two valiant sons). 

They also became strict vegetarians, led a very pious religious life as Hindus. Ramasimhan became a peace loving person. He returned his guns and licensed revolvers to the government which he was using earlier for hunting.He told the government that he no more need the guns, since now he believed in non violence. Uneen dressed up like a brahmin and converted the mosque in front of his home,into his visitor's room for hindu saints and priests who frequemntly visited his home and performed pujas. He stopped gifts to mosques and began contributing to temples.

Kunjahammed, Uneen's younger brother decided to reconvert into Islam, in 1946. He held a meeting of prominent muslims and clerics, to persuade Uneen to revert back.About 30 attended. Ramasimhan,who had thorougly studied hinduism by then,debated successfully with the muslim clerics. The clerics announced that Ramasimhan was possessed by a Kafir Jin and he need to consume 14 oranges,which were ritually blessed. Ramasimhan refused. When a Maulavi criticised the re-conversion as a great mistakes on the part of Ramasimhan, he retorted: "I have not committed any mistake. It was my grandmother who, on being captured by Muslims, committed the fault of converting to Islam. I am re-converting to Hinduism to rectify for the fault and atone for the sin of my grandmother."

#### Aftermath
Their dismembered bodies remained untouched for two days till the Police came. The local Hindus did not dare to claim the bodies to cremate them according to Hindu rituals. They were buried in some corner near old Travellers Bungalow in Malaparamba. Only one Hindu, the RSS pracharak from Nagpur, Sankara Sasthri, was present.

The weapons used for the murder were retrieved from the Kulathur Muthalakkot pond in which they were dumped. Four of the murderers were sentenced to death by the District and Sessions Court at Palghat. The Muslim fundamentalists rallied behind the marauders and raised a huge sum of money for their legal assistance on appeal in the High Court of Madras. The evidence was destroyed and prosecution witnesses were threatened and coerced into silence. Justice Lionel  Clifford Horwill ( ICS) acquitted them saying - "if the police were unable to obtain more evidence it was because the Moplah community largely succeeded in maintaining secrecy".

The young children Fateh Singh and Swaravar Singh escaped death as they were studying in Birla School, Delhi. But, confidants were compelled to hand over the guardianship of his sons to his father-in-law Unni Kammu who forcibly reconverted them to Islam later. 

The demolished Narasimhan Temple was re-built in late 1990s due to valiant efforts of the trust, aided by late RSS Pracharaks CP Janardhanan and late RSS Pracharak and former BMS President, R Venugopalan. The temple and the 60 cents around it have been handed over to the hindus, after a prolonged legal battle.

In 2021, film director Ali Akbar drew inspiration (and name) from rAmasiMhan when he renounced Islam in protest to Islamist celebrations on social media following the news of the death of General Bipin Rawat.
