### गणेश-विद्यार्थि-हत्या #९५

Event occured on 1931-03-25 (gregorian). 

gaNesh shankar vidyArthI, a Hindu kAyastha journalist and nationalist, was killed on this day by a Muslim mob in kAnpur. For 4 days his mutiliated dead-body was lying on a pile of garbage. He had gone to a Muslim majority area of Kanpur to appeal for harmony - and rescue trapped Hindus.

#### Context
Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi (26 October 1890 – 25 March 1931) was a journalist, an Indian National Congress leader, and a friend of Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad. He participated in the non-cooperation movement. He had translated Victor Hugo's novel Ninety-Three, and was the founder-editor of the Hindi language newspaper, Pratap. Due to his activism, he had to face numerous prosecutions, pay heavy fines and suffer five prison sentences. 

In the 1920s, hindu-muslim conflicts spread in western UP. shuddhi movement had grown popular. Even secularist congressmen asserted their defiance against Islamist mobs. For example, in February 1927, Vidyarthi and other Congress leaders had organized a demonstration to the Moolganj mosque and played music for forty minutes - in retaliation to a Muslim mob attacking a musical band accompanying a Hindu marriage procession. 

In 1931, Hindu-Muslim riots took place in Kanpur. Ganesh, recently (9 March 1931) released from jail under the Gandhi–Irwin Pact, was to leave to the Karachi Congress Session, but stayed back. Eyewitnesses note him to have rescued members of both communities; his daughter claimed in an interview that Vidyarthi was murdered while trying to rescue a group of trapped Hindus.

#### Aftermath
Congress came out with a report on riots a month or so later- the document is a stellar template of secular whitewashing, and MK Gandhi declared: "His blood is the cement that will ultimately bind the two communities. No pact will bind our hearts. But heroism such as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi showed is bound in the end to melt the stoniest hearts, melt them into one."

Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Puraskar has been given to renowned journalists by honourable President of India every year from 1989. Sevveral public places and institutions are named after him. On 18 July 2017, UP Government renamed Kanpur airport after him.

### वङ्गहिन्दुकहत्यारम्भः #५५

Event occured on 1971-03-25 (gregorian). 

Operation Searchlight, specially targetting Bengali Hindus and nationalists, began on this day. It marked the beginning of the genocide in bangladesh as well as the Bangla war of liberation.


They put Mujibur Rahman behind bars and ambushed the Dhaka university, resulting in the death of 9 teachers and 200 students in Iqbal Hal. Similarly, the Pakistan army continued with its barbaric attacks on civilians in Old Dhaka, Tejgaon, Indira Road, Mirpur, Kalabagan and other places.

On the same night, several people in Chittagong were shot dead by army personnel. National newspapers, including, Daily Ittefaq, the Daily Sangbad were shut down and their offices were set ablaze, resulting in the death of several media personnel.

Mass graves were dug out and hastily bulldozed. An estimated 700 people were burnt to death in Dhaka. Similarly, they set fire to the houses of slum dwellers, fired bullets at those running away to save their lives, razed a Kali Mandir and also destroyed the Central Shaheed Minar.

#### Aftermath
It is believed that around 10,000-35,000 Bengalis were killed by the Pakistan army under Operation Searchlight. In the months to follow, Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami (lit. Collective of Islamists) killed up to 3 million people, raped between 200k and 400k Bengali women. A further eight to ten million people, mostly Hindus, fled to India.

Of course, the operation failed and backfired, as India under Indira Gandhi intervened and utterly defeated the Islamic republic's military in 14 days. Bangladesh has tried and hanged several war criminals. Pakistan continues to dispute the 1971 genocide.

Contemporary report by Ted Kennedy: 

> "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked H. All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad".
