## उत्सवाः
- सिद्दि-सात-वधः #२८८
### सिद्दि-सात-वधः #२८८

Event occured on 1736-04-29 (gregorian). Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. 

On this day, in the battle of Charai/ Chahrai/ Charegaum/ Kamorle/ marand janjira was forced upon a surprised siddi sAt; and the evil Siddi sAt was killed by chimnAjI appa's forces the next day.

#### Events
Chimnaji Appa under took the work seriously.  
Learning that Siddi Sat had left his base at Anjanvel and moved with all his forces threatening Kolaba, the renowned stronghold built by Shivaji, he diverted his course towards the enemy's quarters and suddenly attacked Siddi Sat as he was encamped near Rewas. The latter had no alternative but to face Chimnaji Appa's 3x cavalry in an open sight. A bloody action ensued at the villages of Charegaum and Kamarlen, in which Siddi Sat was killed while defending him self valiantly. More than 1300 of his brave followers were slain, including Siddi Yakut the defender of Underi, and a much larger number wounded. 

No.192 - 2 May 1736 (Gregorian?)
Chimaji writing about the battle of Charai, where the Siddi Sat was killed.

> Siddi Sat, with his full force came to Revas. We attacked and destroyed it. 60 men were in entrenchments, who were killed. Manaji Angre fought a battle. We lost a good officer. (Not Manaji). 2 more engagements were fought. 50-55 men fell on our side among Angre's forces. The Habshi's province was captured and pillaged. 
> 
> He planned to attack Rajkot. Rajashri Sambhaji Angre was already deployed against him. As soon as Rajashri Angre's letter arrived, we immediately marched fast and intercepted his force near Poyna. 
> 
> On the next day, Siddi Sat with his handpicked forces of around 1500 came to the village of Charai. We deployed our men. The Siddis are a brave people. They endured our firepower and came at us boldly. We lost many men and horses, but with the Swami's blessings, the Siddi Sat was killed. Among his officers, Davkod Naik, Subanji Ghatga, Faim, and Balaji Shenvi were killed. We killed some 1200 to 1300 of his soldiers. Rajashri Angre also reached the battlefield in time. His men also joined in the fray, as I have written earlier. Krishnaji Ghatga's death was written about, earlier, but Krishnaji Bodke escaped. The remaining sardars and jematdars were also killed. His son also escaped by diving into the river and swimming away. The Habshis have taken a major setback.

#### Context
siddi sAt, a competent admiral, was an evil Islamist. He had on shivarAtri day of 1727, surprised the celebrations, demolished the parashurAma temple in chiplun and tortrued + killed several brAhmaNa-s, rousing the ire of svAmI brahmendra and much of marAThas.

#### Aftermath
This signal victory over the implacable Siddi who had destroyed the famous Hindu shrine of Parashuram, roused all Maharashtra to heights of ecstasy and carned an imperishable fame for Chimnaji Appa. There was great jubiliation in the marATha capital.

Saying 

> “By killing Siddi Sat, a demon of the type of Ravana, you have uprooted the very life of the Siddis and earned an undying fame."  

Shahu showered upon Chimnaji honours, costly ornaments and dresses, including a sword set with diamonds. The event naturally unnerved the Siddis of Janjira and induced them to seek a humiliating peace with the Peshwa. Anjanvel and Govalkot alone remained as their mainland posts, and came to be captured much later by Tulaji Angria in January 1745, so that Brahmendra Swami could have a happy death in 1746 after seeing his wrongs fully avenged.
