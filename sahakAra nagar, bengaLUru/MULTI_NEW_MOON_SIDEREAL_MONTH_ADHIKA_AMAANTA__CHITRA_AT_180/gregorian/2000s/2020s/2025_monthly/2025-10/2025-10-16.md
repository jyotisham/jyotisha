### कुञ्जपुर-युद्धम् #२२६

Event occured on 1799-10-16 (gregorian). 

18th-19th Oct 1760 (On ashtami and navami Ashvayuja) - Bhau took Kunjpura on upper yamunA bank in haryANa by storm (having 15k afghAns), Thousands of the enemy (including top generals like Najabat Khan) were killed. The Marathas celebrated Dushehra 'overcoming evil'. The killers of the injured Dattaji Scindia were beheaded on Bhau's orders.

The saying goes - “मराठ्यांनी मोठ्या दिमाखात कुंजपुऱ्या मध्ये दसरा साजरा केला.”

#### Punishment
> Nana Purandare wrote that the Marathas 'astride their horses' stormed the fort and demolished it completely.  
Najabat Khan was injured and died due to his wounds.  
Abdus Samad Khan was killed; his head cut off and carried in the Maratha camp on a lance.  
Qutb Shah was caught alive and brought before Bhau. The episode is narrated in the Bhausaheb bakbar. 'Qutb Shah was caught by Damaji Gaikwad and sent on an elephant to Bhau, Holkar and Jankoji who were all at one place. Seeing him on an elephant, Bhau asked, 'Who sent him on an elephant? Shove him off!' Qutb Shah, seeing his fate was sealed, then offered that if Bhau sought a treaty with Abdali he would arrange it. 'If not, take fifty lakh rupees and release me and I will raise an army of twenty five thousand and attack you'. Bhau asked him, 'Did you kill Dattaji? Qutb Shah replied, 'I followed my religion. It is our norm to cut off the enemy's head, hold it atop a lance.  and play martial music'. An infuriated Bhau ordered "Take him to the dhaal and cut his head off'. Jankoji and Holkar said, it is better to release him and get some great work done by him. Killing him will not bring back Dattaji'; but Bhau did not listen to them. Finally all three agreed and Qutb Shah was taken to the dhaal and beheaded. ...  
Najib Khan's son-in-law and his father were in the camp. They were thrown in prison and tortured to show the places where Najib's wealth was hidden. They showed a treasure of fifteen lakhs. The entire fort of Kunjpura was dug up and destroyed" ...  
The Scindia army felt they had avenged Dattaji's death at the hands of Qutb Shah when lying helpless in the river bed at Burari. The famous elephant of Dattaji named "Zavergaj' was reclaimed.  
Of the principal Afghan chiefs only Najabat Khan's youngest son Diler Khan escaped from the battle.

#### Aftermath
Ahmad Shah was encamped on the left bank of the Yamuna River, which was swollen by rains, and was powerless to aid the garrison. The massacre of the Kunjpura garrison, within sight of the Durrani camp, exasperated Abdali to such an extent that he ordered crossing of the river at all costs. Between 23 and 25 October they were able to cross at Baghpat(a small town about 24 miles up the river), unopposed by the Marathas who were still preoccupied with the sacking of Kunjpura.

When ASA crossed, they turned back to confront him before reaching K'shetra. The blockade was only after mid Dec 1760.

### वीर-पाण्ड्य-कट्ट-ब्रह्मो हतः #२२६

Event occured on 1799-10-16 (gregorian). 

Veerapandya Kattabomman was hanged to death by the British from a tamarind tree at Kayathar on this date in 16 October 1799. Thread on one of the great freedom fighters, who would be an inspiration to many revolutionaries in Tamil Nadu. He was 39.

#### Context
After 1781, British took over navAb of Arkot's finances, and then his army. Thence they went from strength to strength. kaTTabomman, an able warrior from an Andhra-origin family, was adapted and crowned as the ruler on February 2, 1790 by Jagaveera Pandya of Veerapandiyapuram. He repudiated British demands for humble subordination and taxes. British however successfully managed to wean away most of his neighbouring allies, ultimately went to war and won owing to superior military and finiancial might. After repeated attempts, they successfully captured him.

In the trial that followed, Kattabomman, refused to give up on his self respect, and accused the British of illegal, immoral occupation. When the British offered him amnesty, if he asked for a pardon, Kattabomman shot back - "Do what you want cowards".

#### Aftermath
He would inspire a generation of freedom fighters and revolutionaries. There is a memorial at Kayathar, TN where he was hanged to death. Also Indian Navy's communication center at Vijayanarayanam is named after Kattabomman. The biopic of Veerapandya Kattabomman starring Shivaji Ganesan, is regarded as a classic in Tamil cinema.
