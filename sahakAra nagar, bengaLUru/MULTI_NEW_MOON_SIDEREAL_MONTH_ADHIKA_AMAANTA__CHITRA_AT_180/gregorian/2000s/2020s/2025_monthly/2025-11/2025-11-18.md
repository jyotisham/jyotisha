### अनध्यायः

Observed on Kr̥ṣṇa-Caturdaśī tithi of every (lunar) month (Sāṅgavaḥ/paraviddha). 

Anadhyayana on account of chaturdaśī. Several tithis in a month are nitya-anadhyayana days, including prathamā, aṣṭamī, chaturdaśī, amāvāsyā and pūrṇimā. Manu has said that performing adhyayana on these days destroys the Guru (Amavasya), Shishya (Chaturdashi) and the vīrya of the brahma (vēda) itself (Ashtami/Purnima). Similarly, Jabali Rishi has said that Adhyayana on prathama hurts the buddhi while adhyayana on chaturdaśī hurts the brahma (vēda) itself!

हारीतः—  
प्रतिपत्सु चतुर्दश्यामष्टम्यां पर्वणोर्द्वयोः।  
श्वोऽनध्यायेऽद्य शर्वर्यां नाधीयीत कदाचन॥  
मनुः—  
अमावास्या गुरुं हन्ति शिष्यं हन्ति चतुर्दशी।  
ब्रह्माष्टकापौर्णमास्यस्तस्मात्ताः परिवर्जयेदिति॥  
याज्ञवल्क्यः—  
पञ्चदश्यां चतुर्दश्यां अष्टम्यां राहुसूतके।  
जाबालिः—  
नाधीयीत नरो नित्यमादावन्ते च पक्षयोः।  
आदौ च हीयते बुद्धिरन्ते च ब्रह्म हीयते॥  
पक्षादिः प्रतिपत्, पक्षान्तः चतुर्दशी॥

### माधव-राव-क्षयः #२५३

Event occured on 1772-11-18 (gregorian). 

The young but bold and astute visionary, peshvA mAdhava rAv, died of tuberculosis at his favourite Ganesha Chintamani Temple, Theur. Aged 28. Before he died, he had succeeded in reuniting the confrederacy. Grant Duff - "And the plains of Panipat were not more fatal to the Maratha Empire than the early end of this excellent prince…"

Context: Madhavrao was infected with intestinal tuberculosis in May 1770. This disease is characterised by unbearable abdominal pain. Pain was such, that during his last days Madhavrao once asked for a dagger from his uncle to cut his belly so that he might escape from the terrible suffering! Madhavrao's last days were unfortunately very painful. 

He died on 18 November 1772 at 11 o' clock in the morning, with the word 'Gajanan' on his lips. Thousands of citizens visited the site and paid their last respects. Madhavrao was cremated on the banks of the river which was about half a mile from the temple. A small memorial carved out of stone rests today at that place as a memorial. His wife Ramabai chose to commit sati with his body at the time of cremation, even though Brahmin widows were not required to follow the ritual.

### रेज़ाङ्ग-ला-युद्धम् #६३

Event occured on 1962-11-18 (gregorian). 

On this day, during the Sino-Indian War in 1962, Charlie ‘C’ company of 13 Kumaon, consisting of 124 Ahirs, heroically stopped Chinese at Rezang La. 114 out of about 120 Indians died killing about 1k Chinese soldiers.

#### The fight
The company was led by Major Shaitan Singh, who won a posthumous Param Vir Chakra for his actions. From the Indian point of view, Rezang La had the drawback that an intervening feature blocked artillery operation, so that the Indian infantry had to do without artillery cover.

> When Rezang La was later revisited dead jawans were found in the trenches still holding on to their weapons... every single man of this company was found dead in his trench with several bullets or splinter wounds. The 2-inch mortar man died with a bomb still in his hand. The medical orderly had a syringe and bandage in his hands when the Chinese bullet hit him... Of the thousand mortar bombs with the defenders, all but seven had been fired and the rest were ready to be fired when the (mortar) section was overrun.

#### Aftermath
The inscription on the War Memorial at Chushul, Ladakh raised by the Indian Army in memory of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Rezang La, reads as below:

> How can a man die better,  
Than facing fearful odds,  
For the ashes of his fathers,  
And temples of his gods.

### तैमूरेण भट्नेर-ग्रहणम् #६२७

Event occured on 1398-11-18 (gregorian). Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. 

On this day, Taimur captured Bhatnair fort from Rai Dalachandra.

#### Events (from MT)
The fort of Bhatnair stood on this road and offered formidable defense against the invader. Timur promptly besieged the fort after sweeping through the countryside and forced Rai Dalachandra into the defensive. On 10th November 1398, he suddenly assaulted fort with giant fort-breaking ballistas that hurled huge rocks over a ton on the fort walls. Prince Shah Rukh, Mazid al Baghdadi and Jahan Maliq, Timur’s fierce generals, led the assault on the Hindus. The Hindus retaliated with a heavy rain of fireworks from their ramparts, but the Timurids pushed on building mines to break the ramparts. 

Finally, the fort ramparts were demolished and the Timurid army rushed into the fort capturing Dalachandra and killing other defenders after much desperate fighting at close quarters.

Other sources claim: "Dulachand initially opposed Timur but when hard-pressed he considered surrender. He was locked outside the walls of Bhatner by his brother and was later killed by Timur. The garrison of Bhatner then fought and were slaughtered to the last man. Bhatner was looted and burned to the ground."

#### Context
Timur was on his way to wrest Delhi and India from the Tughlaqs, who had weakened.
