Event occured on 1971-05-26 (gregorian). 

On May 26, 1971, the Pakistani army + Razakars singled out and murdered 94 Hindus at Burunga High School in Bangladesh.

#### Events
Hindus and Muslims from the village assembled at Burunga High School on the morning of May 26. The purpose of their gathering was to participate in the peace committee meeting. By 8 am, approximately a thousand individuals had gathered at the school premises. At around 9 am, the Pakistani army arrived at Burunga High School, accompanied by Abdul Ahad Chaudhary, the commander of the nearby Karansi village Razakar group, and Abdul Khaleque, the village doctor. The Pakistan Army obtained the list of individuals from the Peace Committee and proceeded to conduct thorough house-to-house searches in the village. Those who had not attended the Peace Committee meeting at the high school were forcibly taken out of their houses and brought to the school grounds.

The Hindus were directed to the school office, while the Muslims were confined to a classroom. They were compelled to recite the Kalma and sing the national anthem of Pakistan. At approximately 9:30, Abdul Ahad Chaudhry, accompanied by a Pakistani soldier, demanded that the people surrender any money and jewellery they possessed. Following this, the majority of Muslims were released. The Pakistani soldiers instructed the Muslim villagers to procure a nylon rope and tightly tie all the Hindus together.

The individuals who were unable to escape were forcibly assembled on the school grounds under the watch of Pakistani soldiers. Their hands were bound and then they were shot. The assailants proceeded to douse them with kerosene and set ablaze ensuring that no Hindu remained alive. Led by Abdul Ahad Chaudhary and Dr Abdul Khaleque, the local Razakars proceeded to pillage the entire village and set fire to the houses of Hindus.

Event occured on 1964-05-26 (gregorian). 

In a pre-planned attack on 3k Indians of Wismar, Guyana тАУ many Indians were murdered, many Indian men were beaten and brutalised, hundreds of Indian women were raped, many females were stripped naked, children were terrorised and traumatised, countless Indian homes and business were burned down, and with all fleeing Wismar for safety elsewhere.

PeopleтАЩs National Congress (PNC) held its party congress in Mackenzie, that adjoins Wismar, and celebrated the victory. Linden Forbes Burnham described May 26, 1964 as a day of victory because it was a day of defeat of Indians in Wismar-McKenzie, of running them out of the area. He renamed the place after himself, Linden. And he deliberately chose May 26 as the date for GuyanaтАЩs independence

Event occured on 1665-05-26 (gregorian). Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. 

Mogols under Jai Singh, assisted by the paThAn Dilir Khan (with nephews Ghairat and Muzaffar), had beseiged closely situated purandara and rudramal forts. H mansabdArs of mogols like kirAta-simha, haribhAn kunwar, udaybhAn, chaturbhuj chauhAN, mitrasen, indraman bundela assisted. Daud Khan and Qutb ud Din khAn had also joined. With huge cannons named 'Abdulla Khan', 'Fath Lashkar' and 'havelI' taken up opposite summits, the beseigers had downed rudramal. Mogols mined and bombarded safed-burj and kAlA burj - the undermining of which would lead to capture of the lower fort.

Taking 700 select men murAr bAjI prabhu sallied out in a desperate melee and attacked dilIr khAn. 500 paThAns died as did 300 marAThas. murAr and few desperados dashed right up to dilIr khAn's position. Refusing generous surrender promises, he ran up to dilIr khAn sword in hand. dilIr downed him with an arrow. The rest ran back to the fort to defend it to the death. (sabhAsad chronicle.)

Observed on M┼лl─Б nakshatra of Vr╠ес╣гabhaс╕е (sidereal solar) month (Pr─Бtaс╕е/paraviddha). 

Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the тАШThe FourтАЩ (n─Бlvar) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 16th Nayanmar, Muruga Nayanmar, known for his exemplary worship of Bhagavan Shiva, was born in Tirupukalur, a place renowned for its association with many Nayanmars. His devotion manifested in a specific form of worship, which included performing Archana with flowers as described in the Shiva Agamas, offering floral garlands to the deity, and reciting the Panchakshara Mantra. This mantra, found in the central portion of the Sri Rudradhyayi within the Yajur Veda, is highly revered for its power to liberate devotees from the cycle of birth and death.

Every day, Muruga Nayanmar would rise before dawn, complete his daily rituals including a bath and applying sacred ash, and then head to the garden. While chanting the Panchakshara Mantra, he would collect flowers and meticulously craft colorful garlands following the guidelines of the Shiva Agamas, which he would then offer to Bhagavan Shiva.

A significant event in Muruga Nayanmar's life was the arrival of the revered Jnana Sambandar to Tirupukalur. Muruga Nayanmar extended an invitation to Sambandar, worshiped him, and earned his favor, leading to a deep friendship. This bond culminated in a profound spiritual experience at Sambandar's wedding, where Muruga Nayanmar, along with Sambandar, the bride, and others (including Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar and Tiruneelakanta Yazhpanar), merged into the Divine Effulgence of Bhagavan Shiva. This event epitomises the Tamil proverb which states that the rarest achievement is gaining the favor of the great, a feat Muruga Nayanmar accomplished through his devotion, earning him not just Sambandar's friendship but also divine realization.

Event occured on 1950-05-26 (gregorian). 

On this day, shabarImala temple was found desecrated. Police report (by DIG KK Menon) suspected Christians.

First noticed by a priest on June 14, 1950, the arson was reported to police two days later by the commissioner and the president of Travancore Devaswom Board. The temple was last closed on May 20. The priest, his subordinates and some worshippers had left the place, with nobody staying back. When Kollam district superintendent of police visited the place, he had noticed that, тАЬThe idol was found broken; the head, left hand palm and fingers separated. There were cut marks on the face of the idol as well as on the forehead.тАЭ The enquiry had found out that the fire was not an accident. There were 15 cut marks of violence on the door leading to the sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum), indicating forcible entry, the report said. Police had found traces of brass on the sharp edge of an axe found from the spot. Theft attempt was ruled out as silver, gold and utensils were not taken away.

Aftermath: The temple was rebuilt, the stone idol replaced with a metal one.

Observed on M┼лl─Б nakshatra of Vr╠ес╣гabhaс╕е (sidereal solar) month (Pr─Бtaс╕е/paraviddha). 

Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe.

They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 28th of the Nayanmars, Thirugnana Sambandar, born to a devout Brahmana couple---Shivapada Hridayar and Bhagavatiar---in 7th-century Sirkazhi, was an answer to his father's prayers for a son who would revive the glory of Shaivism. At the age of three, during a visit to the Sattainathar Shiva Temple, Sambandar was left by his parents near a pond. While alone, he began to cry and was comforted and fed by Devi Parvati and Bhagavan Shiva, appearing as Thoniappar. His parents found milk on his lips and upon questioning, Sambandar pointed skyward and spontaneously composed his first hymn, тАЬThodudaiya Seviyan,тАЭ symbolizing his reception of divine wisdom or Shivajnanam. This event marked him as Thirugnana Sambandar, the Nayanmar of divine knowledge, and Aludaiya Pillayar, the BhagavanтАЩs child.

Celebrated as Tala Vendan, the unrivaled master of rhythm in the Periyapuranam, Sambandar demonstrated prodigious talents from a young age. By the time he was seven, he began singing about the Vedas and authored a significant collection of hymns, forming volumes 1-3 of the Thirumurai.

Sambandar, from an early age, showed remarkable spiritual gifts, composing and singing hymns in praise of Bhagavan Shiva, now known as Thevaram. During a pilgrimage, he met Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar (the 61st of the Nayanmars), an expert musician, who became his constant companion. Sambandar's journey was filled with miraculous events --- he was given a pair of golden cymbals by Bhagavan Shiva, received a pearl palanquin from the Bhagavan to ease his travels, and his divine hymns healed the sick and performed wonders.

In Madurai, dominated by Jainism, Sambandar played a crucial role in re-establishing Shaivism. He miraculously cured the Jain king of a burning ailment using sacred ash and defeated the Jains in various spiritual challenges. His actions led to the king embracing Shaivism and the resurgence of the faith in the region.

SambandarтАЩs life was marked by his profound devotion and the numerous miracles he performed. He brought a merchant's dead daughter back to life and helped many others through his spiritual powers. As his wedding approached at the age of 16, Sambandar prayed to Shiva for liberation. During his wedding, a miraculous blaze of light, the Shiva Jyoti, appeared. As he recited the тАЬPanchakshara Padigam,тАЭ everyone present --- including Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar, Muruga Nayanmar and Tiruneelakanta Yazhpanar --- were absorbed into a divine light, merging with Bhagavan Shiva! His legacy continues to influence and inspire Shaivite devotion and music.

Observed on M┼лl─Б nakshatra of Vr╠ес╣гabhaс╕е (sidereal solar) month (Pr─Бtaс╕е/paraviddha). 

Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the тАШThe FourтАЩ (n─Бlvar) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar was a devout follower of Bhagavan Shiva from Tiru Erukattanpuliyur in the Chola kingdom. Renowned for his skill in playing the Yazh, a traditional musical instrument similar to the Veena, he traveled to various sacred shrines to sing praises of the Bhagavan. During a visit to Madura, he stood at the temple entrance, playing and singing. Bhagavan Shiva, desiring to hear YazhpanarтАЩs music more closely, communicated through dreams to his devotees to invite Yazhpanar into the inner shrine.

The next day, the Brahmanas led Yazhpanar into the shrine. Surprised but understanding this as Bhagavan Shiva's divine play, Yazhpanar played the Yazh with even greater fervor. Miraculously, a heavenly voice suggested providing a golden seat to avoid damaging the instrument on the wet floor. Yazhpanar was then offered a golden seat, where he continued his devotional singing, expressing gratitude for the BhagavanтАЩs compassion.

Later, Yazhpanar visited Tiruvarur. Here, too, he initially sang outside the shrine. In response to his devotion, Bhagavan Shiva created a new opening on the northern side of the temple specifically for Yazhpanar. Recognizing this as another divine gesture, Yazhpanar entered through the gate and sang in the immediate presence of the Bhagavan. 

His journey with Sambandar and eventual attainment of Liberation is of note: During a pilgrimage, Sambandar met Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar, who became his constant companion.  As his wedding approached at age 16, Sambandar prayed to Shiva for liberation. During this time, a miraculous blaze of light, the Shiva Jyoti, appeared. As he recited the тАЬPanchakshara Padigam,тАЭ everyone present --- including Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar, Muruga Nayanmar and Tiruneelakanta Yazhpanar --- were absorbed into a divine light, merging with Bhagavan Shiva! His legacy continues to influence and inspire Shaivite devotion and music.

Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars.

Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar, the 26th of the Nayanmars, was a devout Brahmana proficient in Agamas, and resided in Tirusattamangai, a spiritually vibrant city in the Chola kingdom. Known for its dedicated Brahmanas and the temple of Ayavanthinathar (today's Brahmapureeshvarar (Ayavandheeshvarar) Svaami Temple https://maps.app.goo.gl/DHqaB7hJypLzZRUH9), this city was a centre of Shiva worship. During a Tiruvathirai festival, while Tiruneelanakka and his wife were worshiping in the temple, she instinctively blew on the Shiva Lingam to clean it from a spider, accidentally spitting on the the Shiva Lingam, an act her devout husband perceived as desecration. Angered, he abandoned her and returned home alone.

That night, Bhagavan Ayavanthinathar appeared in Tiruneelanakka's dream, showing that the part of His body his wife spat on was the only part not affected by the spider's poison, revealing the greatness of her devotion. Realising this, Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar joyously reconciled with his wife, understanding the Lingam as a living presence, not just a stone.

When the revered Tiru Jnana Sambandar (the 28th of the Nayanmars) visited Tirusattamangai with companions, Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar welcomed them but hesitated to accommodate the non-Brahmana companions inside his home, asking them to sleep near the sacrificial pit. Miraculously, the sacrificial fire ignited by itself near them, enlightening Nayanmar about the transcendence of caste through devotion. Sambandar, acknowledging Nayanmar's devotion, included him in a song of praise.

Yearning to be in Sambandar's presence, Tiruneelanakkar later attended Sambandar's wedding in Nallur Perumanam. When Sambandar merged into the divine light of Bhagavan Shiva, Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar also attained union with the divine, fulfilling his deepest spiritual longing.
