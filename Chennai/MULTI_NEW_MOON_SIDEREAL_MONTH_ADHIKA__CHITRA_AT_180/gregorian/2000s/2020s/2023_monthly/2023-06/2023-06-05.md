Observed on M┼лl─Б nakshatra of Vr╠ес╣гabhaс╕е (sidereal solar) month (Pr─Бtaс╕е/paraviddha). 

Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Lord Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the тАШThe FourтАЩ (ta:n─Бlvar) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 16th Nayanmar, Muruga Nayanmar, known for his exemplary worship of Lord Shiva, was born in Tirupukalur, a place renowned for its association with many Nayanmars. His devotion manifested in a specific form of worship, which included performing Archana with flowers as described in the Shiva Agamas, offering floral garlands to the deity, and reciting the Panchakshara Mantra. This mantra, found in the central portion of the Sri Rudradhyayi within the Yajur Veda, is highly revered for its power to liberate devotees from the cycle of birth and death.

Every day, Muruga Nayanmar would rise before dawn, complete his daily rituals including a bath and applying sacred ash, and then head to the garden. While chanting the Panchakshara Mantra, he would collect flowers and meticulously craft colorful garlands following the guidelines of the Shiva Agamas, which he would then offer to Lord Shiva.

A significant event in Muruga Nayanmar's life was the arrival of the revered Jnana Sambandar to Tirupukalur. Muruga Nayanmar extended an invitation to Sambandar, worshiped him, and earned his favor, leading to a deep friendship. This bond culminated in a profound spiritual experience at Sambandar's wedding, where Muruga Nayanmar, along with Sambandar, the bride, and others, experienced a merging into the Divine Effulgence of Lord Shiva. This event epitomises the Tamil proverb which states that the rarest achievement is gaining the favor of the great, a feat Muruga Nayanmar accomplished through his devotion, earning him not just Sambandar's friendship but also divine realization.

Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Lord Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar (Thirunavukkarasar), Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavachakar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the тАШThe FourтАЩ (ta:n─Бlvar) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 28th of the Nayanmars, Thirugnana Sambandar, born to a devout Brahmana couple---Shivapada Hridayar and Bhagavatiar---in 7th-century Sirkazhi, was an answer to his father's prayers for a son who would revive the glory of Shaivism. At the age of three, during a visit to the Sattainathar Shiva Temple, Sambandar was left by his parents near a pond. While alone, he began to cry and was comforted and fed by Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva, appearing as Thoniappar. His parents found milk on his lips and upon questioning, Sambandar pointed skyward and spontaneously composed his first hymn, тАЬThodudaiya Seviyan,тАЭ symbolizing his reception of divine wisdom or Shivajnanam. This event marked him as Thirugnana Sambandar, the Nayanmar of divine knowledge, and Aludaiya Pillayar, the LordтАЩs child.

Celebrated as Tala Vendan, the unrivaled master of rhythm in the Periyapuranam, Sambandar demonstrated prodigious talents from a young age. By the time he was seven, he began singing about the Vedas and authored a significant collection of hymns, forming volumes 1-3 of the Thirumurai.

Sambandar, from an early age, showed remarkable spiritual gifts, composing and singing hymns in praise of Lord Shiva, now known as Thevaram. During a pilgrimage, he met Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar (the 61st of the Nayanmars), an expert musician, who became his constant companion. Sambandar's journey was filled with miraculous events --- he was given a pair of golden cymbals by Lord Shiva, received a pearl palanquin from the Lord to ease his travels, and his divine hymns healed the sick and performed wonders.

In Madurai, dominated by Jainism, Sambandar played a crucial role in re-establishing Shaivism. He miraculously cured the Jain king of a burning ailment using sacred ash and defeated the Jains in various spiritual challenges. His actions led to the king embracing Shaivism and the resurgence of the faith in the region.

SambandarтАЩs life was marked by his profound devotion and the numerous miracles he performed. He brought a merchant's dead daughter back to life and helped many others through his spiritual powers. As his wedding approached at age 16, Sambandar prayed to Shiva for liberation. During this time, a miraculous blaze of light, the Shiva Jyoti, appeared. As he recited the тАЬPanchakshara Padigam,тАЭ everyone present --- including Tiruneelakanta Nayanmar, Muruga Nayanmar and Tiruneelakanta Yazhpanar --- were absorbed into a divine light, merging with Lord Shiva! His legacy continues to influence and inspire Shaivite devotion and music.

Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar was a devout follower of Lord Shiva from Tiru Erukattanpuliyur in the Chola kingdom. Renowned for his skill in playing the Yazh, a traditional musical instrument similar to the Veena, he traveled to various sacred shrines to sing praises of the Lord. During a visit to Madura, he stood at the temple entrance, playing and singing. Lord Shiva, desiring to hear YazhpanarтАЩs music more closely, communicated through dreams to his devotees to invite Yazhpanar into the inner shrine.

The next day, the Brahmins led Yazhpanar into the shrine. Surprised but understanding this as Lord Shiva's divine play, Yazhpanar played the Yazh with even greater fervor. Miraculously, a heavenly voice suggested providing a golden seat to avoid damaging the instrument on the wet floor. Yazhpanar was then offered a golden seat, where he continued his devotional singing, expressing gratitude for the LordтАЩs compassion.

Later, Yazhpanar visited Tiruvarur. Here, too, he initially sang outside the shrine. In response to his devotion, Lord Shiva created a new opening on the northern side of the temple specifically for Yazhpanar. Recognizing this as another divine gesture, Yazhpanar entered through the gate and sang in the immediate presence of the Lord. 

His journey with Sambandar and eventual attainment of Liberation is of note: During a pilgrimage, Sambandar met Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar, who became his constant companion.  As his wedding approached at age 16, Sambandar prayed to Shiva for liberation. During this time, a miraculous blaze of light, the Shiva Jyoti, appeared. As he recited the тАЬPanchakshara Padigam,тАЭ everyone present --- including Tiruneelakanta Nayanmar, Muruga Nayanmar and Tiruneelakanta Yazhpanar --- were absorbed into a divine light, merging with Lord Shiva! His legacy continues to influence and inspire Shaivite devotion and music.

Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Lord Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe.

They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar, the 26th of the Nayanmars, was a devout Brahmana proficient in Agamas, and resided in Tirusattamangai, a spiritually vibrant city in the Chola kingdom. Known for its dedicated Brahmanas and the temple of Ayavanthinathar (today's Brahmapureeshvarar (Ayavandheeshvarar) Svaami Temple https://maps.app.goo.gl/DHqaB7hJypLzZRUH9), this city was a centre of Shiva worship. During a Tiruvathirai festival, while Tiruneelanakka and his wife were worshiping in the temple, she instinctively blew on the Shiva Lingam to clean it from a spider, accidentally spitting on the the Shiva Lingam, an act her devout husband perceived as desecration. Angered, he abandoned her and returned home alone.

That night, Lord Ayavanthinathar appeared in Tiruneelanakka's dream, showing that the part of His body his wife spat on was the only part not affected by the spider's poison, revealing the greatness of her devotion. Realising this, Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar joyously reconciled with his wife, understanding the Lingam as a living presence, not just a stone.

When the revered Tiru Jnana Sambandar (the 28th of the Nayanmars) visited Tirusattamangai with companions, Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar welcomed them but hesitated to accommodate the non-Brahmana companions inside his home, asking them to sleep near the sacrificial pit. Miraculously, the sacrificial fire ignited by itself near them, enlightening Nayanmar about the transcendence of caste through devotion. Sambandar, acknowledging Nayanmar's devotion, included him in a song of praise.

Yearning to be in Sambandar's presence, Tiruneelanakka later attended Sambandar's wedding in Nallur Perumanam. When Sambandar merged into the divine light of Lord Shiva, Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar also attained union with the divine, fulfilling his deepest spiritual longing.
