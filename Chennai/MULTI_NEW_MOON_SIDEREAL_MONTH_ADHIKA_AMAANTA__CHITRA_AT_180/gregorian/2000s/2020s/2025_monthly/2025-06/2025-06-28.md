### рд╣рд▓реНрджреАрдШрд╛рдЯреА-рдпреБрджреНрдзрдореН #рекрекреп

Event occured on 1576-06-28 (gregorian). Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. 

On this day, pratApasiMha and his subjects (from all varNa-s including v1 and v3 to bhils) fought mogols at haldIghATI.

The mogol side was led by the traitorous Kacchavaha general of Akbar, Man Singh. They outnumbered pratAp's side 5:1; and were filled with professional soldiers. (Prof K S Gupta: Most Rajput treaties [eg. 1569 Bundi-Mughal treaty] with Akbar had a clause that they would not be asked to join arms against Mewar. Kachhwahas were the only exception.)

From Vanguard to rear:

- 85 Arab commandos under the vicious Arab general Sayyid Hashim al Barhai.
- Then, Kacchavaha Hindu horsemen led by Rao Jagannath + horsemen of Mohammedan Mongols under Baqshi Ali Asaf Khan, the Khwaja of Kazvin in Persia. 
- Then the Iltmish brigade under the cousin of Man Singh, Madhav Singh with the second Kacchavaha corps. The center was under Man Singh with the third Kacchavaha force.
- 3 brigades of the left wing: 
  - Tajiks under Mullah Ghazi Khan, the veteran Jihadist from Tajikistan.
  - The traitor Rao Lonakarna leading a force of Kacchavahas from the Sambhar lake.
  - The Shaikhzada division formed by the prolific clansmen of Sufi Shaikh Salim Chishti.
- The right-wing was formed by the vicious Arab clansmen of Sayyid Hashim al Barhai. 
- The rear-guard was formed by the brigade of Mihtar Khan and his Central Asian Kazakh warriors.

pratApasiMha's side:

- frontline charging force under Ramdas Rathod, the valiant son of Jaimal who died defending Chittor. Supported by Bhim Singh, the Rao Chundavat, and Hakim Khan Sur with his fellow Pathans who stayed true to his pledge despite being enticed for jihAd (Afghans having been deposed by bAbur's invasion).
- Pratap in the center with his elite rAjaputras.
- 2 brigades of the right wing
  - Ram Singh Tanwar the king of Gwalior
  - vaishya division under the valiant 3 sons and the brother Tarachand of the rich businessman Bahman (aka bhAmA) Shah
- Left wing - Jhala clan of the Rajputs under Mana
- Reserve
  - brahmin brigade led by PratapтАЩs purohita Jagannatha
  - brigade formed by the Mehta businessmen and the Charanas
  - Bhil archers under the Bhil chieftain Panja

Thus, all sections of the Hindu society were represented in the struggle to defend against Islamist gAzi-s.

Outcome: Fierce battle. mahArANA pratAp wounded, as was his horse chetak. He escaped to fight on from the forests. By 1579, pratApasiMha would recover much of the western part of his kingdom. Chittor and the rest of eastern Mewar continued to remain under Mughal control.

### рд▓рд╛рд▓-рдХрдиреНрд╣рдпреНрдпрд╛-рд╣рддреНрдпрд╛ #рей

Event occured on 2022-06-28 (gregorian). 

On this anniversary  (as per Gregorian calendar) of the battle of Haldighati, in the very same udayapura of mahrANa pratApasiMha, at about 2:45PM, two young jihAdis - Mohammed Riyaz Akhtar and Mohammed Ghous - posing as customers suddenly attacked and murdered a tailor kanhaiya lAl when he was taking measurements. They had circulated videos threatening to carry out the attack (and instigating correligionist mobsters to do the same); also a video of the attack, and further a post-attack video boasting of the attack with display of bloody butcher knifes, with threats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

#### Motive
Nupur Sharma, BJP spokesperson, in a heated TV debate in the background of the discovery of a shiva-linga being used to wash feet in jNAnavApI masjid in kAshI and subsequent mocking of hindu reverence, had referred to the account (from the authoritative Islamic hadis shAhih bhukari) of impregnation of a 9 year old by "sab se nek insAn" of the "religion of peace". This upset a lot of muslims, who began making death threats to varied hindu-s, including those who supported Nupur Sharma's right to refer to authoritative Islamic beliefs about their prophet - This despite BJP suspending Nupur Sharma in appeasement of Islamic countries and people, Nupur's apology, and several police complaints and legal action against her. 

One of these was kanhaiya lAl, whose social media account had shared some post in support of Nupur. (kanhaiya claimed that it was his son who had inadvertantly shared this post.) On June 11, Lal's neighbor Nazim had registered a police complaint against him - but kanhaiya got bail. On June 15, Lal had filed a request for protection with the local police after receiving death threats from nAzim and five others. Lal alleged that the group had circulated his photo within their community on social media with a message that Lal should be killed if seen anywhere or if he opens his shop. The police - instead of protecting him, claimed to have mediated and settled the matter. 

#### Radicalization
Both the killers had gone on Haj Umrah pilgrimage.

Mohammed Ghous had, according to later police statements, had developed links with Dawat-e-Islami and Tehrik-e-Labiak (barelvi), the Islamist organizations from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, had visited that terrorist state in 2014 and maintained whatsapp contact thereafter.

Riyaz Akhtari used to work at a local mosque in Udaipur and was involved in spreading religious propaganda. He had lived in Dubai. Even as he was quite radicalized (he acquired in 2013 the bike number 2611 acquired at cost of Rs 5k - reminiscent of the date of mumbai islamic terror attack by Ajmal Kasab and co), and even though he used to criticize BJP in private, he used to attend BJP events and tried to infiltrate the party. Riyaz's family had vacated their house on the day of the butchery. He crafted the knifes used for the murder.

#### Egging by the ulema
Ajmer Sufi Dargah - whose Sarwar Chishti said he will make India tremble through his upcoming agitation; whose Gauhar Chishti met Udaipur killers; whose Salman Chishti announced a reward for beheading Nupur - has an annual income of Rs 200 crores (70% from Hindus).

#### Aftermath
A handful of people were there at the place, all fled - only a Rajput assistant, Ishwar Singh fought the Jihadis, sustained severe injuries and was admitted to Maharana Bhupal Hospital.) The assailants fled on foot and then drove away on a motorcycle (with special number 2611). Rajput boys Shakti Singh and Prahlad Singh Chudawat of Rajsamand trailed the Udaipur killers and helped Police nab them.

Members of Hindu organizations instantly protested, and refused to allow the police to remove the body until the culprits were captured at 8 PM.

Local authorities of Udaipur imposed a 24-hour curfew and blocked internet access across the state of Rajasthan. Thousands of people rallied and protested in udayapura. Within a day of the murder, hindus had gathered over a crore rupees for the Hindu tailor's family and that of the injured Ishvar Singh.

### рдкреБрдЧрд┤реНрддреНрддреБрдгреИ рдирд╛рдпрдйреНрдорд╛рд░реН (релрем) рдЧреБрд░реБрдкреВрдЬреИ

Observed on ─А┼Ыr─Ус╣г─Б nakshatra of Mithunam (sidereal solar) month (Pr─Бtaс╕е/paraviddha). 

Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the тАШThe FourтАЩ (n─Бlvar) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

This Nayanmar, a devout Adi Shaiva from Seruviliputhur (presently Azhagaputhur), was deeply committed to serving Bhagavan Shiva as a temple priest. His daily ritual included bathing the deity with mantras and conducting Puja according to Shiva Agamas. During a severe famine, he faced extreme financial hardship and could not afford food, yet his devotion to his duties was unwavering. Despite his growing physical weakness, he persisted in performing the Puja, his love for the deity undiminished. On one occasion, as he was performing the Abhishekam (bathing ritual), he became so weak that he accidentally dropped the water pot onto the Lingam, leading him to faint from exhaustion.

In his unconscious state, he had a dream in which Bhagavan Shiva assured him of providing a gold coin daily in the temple until the end of the famine. This divine intervention would enable him to buy food and sustain himself. Upon awakening, he discovered the dream to be a reality; a gold coin miraculously appeared in the temple every day. This divine support allowed him to survive the famine and continue his devoted service. He maintained his dedication to the temple rituals and eventually attained the blessed abode of Bhagavan Shiva.

He is depicted with folded hands (Anjali mudra) and sometimes holding a pot of water! Pugazh Thunai Nayanmar, along with his wife Lakshmi, is revered in the front hall of the Padikasu Nathar Temple (Swarnapureeshwarar Temple https://maps.app.goo.gl/SxWDzUZtebtbp3WEA). Their lineage still upholds the tradition of serving as priests in the temple. As a tribute to the story of Pugazh Thunai Nayanar, worshippers place two coins at the base of the lingam, and then carry one of these coins back with them as a token.
