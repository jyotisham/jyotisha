Welcome to the static folder of this theme.

## External (managed) dependencies
External css and js dependencies (located under the node_modules directory) are managed using yarn.
Look up the internet for yarn commands to add, remove or install dependencies.

### Motivation
Why do we not just use js and css files served off some fast CDN? Because we want to be able to generate the files locally.

## Local files and unmanaged dependencies
Those are the remaining files in this directory.
